Modelling of financial returns takes two approaches: simulated or real data.

#### Simulated Data

Simulated data is used widely in the financial industry because it is quantiatively simple and allows costless generation of new data.  

The average historical return of asset X is Y% and the annual variation in that mean is Z%. We input this data into a statistical model (for example, a normal N(Y, Z)), and can create lots of simulated data by repeatedly querying that model.

Any financial simulation using this model appears to offer certainty. We have lots of data. Every possible outcome is accounted for.

But how well does our model represent reality? If our model does not represent reality then our simulations are wrong too.

And, in most cases, investors do use the wrong models. Events that are frequently modelled as occurring once every thousand plus years, actually occur every decade or less. For an investor with a multi-decade period, this is a significant difference.

#### Real data

Real data doesn't require a statistical model. We don't need a hypothesis about the distribution of returns. We just take our portfolio allocation, and see how it would have fared in the real world. 

This comes with a few problems.

First, how representative is our sample? Real data represents the probability of extreme events far better but only given a sample of sufficient size. 

Our sample is large: hundreds of years across sixteen countries. Even then, we only see total loss once with Germany's hyperinflation of 1923/24. 

Second, historical returns often belie the complexity of reality. Our sample includes two nuclear bombs being dropped, world war, capital controls, hyperinflation, etc. All we see is one number: annual return.

What price can you put on liquidity? On your house being destroyed? On the govt forcing you to buy their debt? On the govt stopping you from buying gold? Stopping you from owning non-domestic assets? None of this is in our data. None of this is in any data. But this ommission is inherently optimistic.

Third, we use US inflation to calculate real returns. Inflation in the US has been generally lower so real returns are slightly overstated. We hope to add more options soon.

Fourth, estimates of historical returns are inherently uncertain. In the past, data often wasn't collected systematically. The data itself is reasonably clear but it is less clear what data is missing or how we should interpret that data (for example, indexes usually didn't exist so whilst there was price data, there was no "market" index).

Finally, our sample only includes the most successful economies of today. We include the rise of Japan but not the fall of Russia or Argentina.

The median compounded real return from 60/40 in our sample is 500bps. Based on our reading of more comprehensive sources, the overstatement here is probably 100-200bps. As an example, Austro-Hungary was a large component of the world index in the early 20th century before going to zero.

Despite those weaknesses though, we have a sample that is more representative than simulated data. And if investors interpret any long-term estimate of historical returns conservatively and with an understanding of context, then they should have a good idea of what is actually achieveable.
